<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE
MEMBERS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH<br />
Vindicated.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> times and under circumstances of
an ordinary character, the letter, to which the following pages
refer, might with safety be left to find its proper place in the
public mind.&nbsp; It is characterized by a spirit of mildness
and conciliation; and, as much of its censure is founded on
erroneous impressions, the consequences would have been but
momentary.&nbsp; But, in the present extraordinary times, there
are not wanting those who would gladly seize upon the occasion,
as a favourable one for widening the differences and perpetuating
the antipathies, which unhappily prevail among Christians, and
hence it appears desirable that the public should be set right
with regard to the course now taken by those who are implicated
in the charges.</p>
<p>The main charges appear to be:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That the parties in question have acted unkindly and
disrespectfully, so far as they have interfered with the
arrangements for the exhibition in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>II.&nbsp;
An assumption, (perfectly groundless,) that the plan of the
proposed society would exclude all children except those of
parents belonging to the Established Church, and</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; That a society embracing in its direction and
operations, all sects and denominations, would have worked more
for the public good than the one proposed.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind, that the exhibition, in St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, was Mr. Wilderspin&rsquo;s own
speculation.&nbsp; By myself and by some others, it was however
favourably viewed, under an impression that a feeling would be
excited where none had previously existed, and that it might
possibly open the way for an extension of the system.&nbsp; Mr.
W. was requested to meet a few gentlemen, at the Hall in the
Market, to explain to them the nature of his system, and he there
again mentioned his intention of assembling the children for
examination in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; He was distinctly
asked whether the directors or the committee of those schools had
been consulted, and he as plainly replied that there would be no
difficulty on that head.&nbsp; On the subject of the expenses the
way was not so clear,&mdash;with his usual liberality he declared
that he did not seek remuneration, but still he thought he ought
to be indemnified from loss&mdash;and after some loose discussion
it was agreed that those present should be responsible for any
loss.&nbsp; It was finally arranged that free tickets of
admission should be given to the Sunday school <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>and other
teachers.&nbsp; Of these, 300 were distributed to the various
<span class="smcap">Dissenting Congregations</span> in the
city.&nbsp; The public were admitted at sixpence each person, and
the proceeds went to the erection of the gallery, the purchase of
buns for the children, and a gratuity to Mr. Wilderspin; a small
contribution being collected from the <i>responsibles</i> to make
up this sum.</p>
<p>I think, therefore, that my reverend friend, for so I beg in
sincerity to designate him, must have been misinformed on some
points which drew from him the charge that we had taken
unwarrantable liberties either with the money or the schools of
others.</p>
<p>But another and far more important error is manifest at pages
10 and 19, where I understand him to mean that it is intended to
exclude the children of all except those of the members of the
Established Church.&nbsp; Now this is an impression so utterly at
variance with truth and fact, that I cannot conceive what part of
the proceedings can have been so distorted, as to admit of such
an interpretation.&nbsp; I have seen the progress of the society
in embryo first, last, midst, and throughout all, without
witnessing any symptoms of such a spirit.&nbsp; Should it appear,
I am prepared to contend with it hand to hand&mdash;foot to foot,
and should it unhappily prevail, I should feel bound to quit the
society, however painful it might be to part from one in whose
work my almost entire public services and affections are bound
up.</p>
<p>On entering upon the subject of the union of all denominations
in this work of benevolence, it appears <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>to me, that my reverend friend has
suffered the question of what is <i>practicable</i> completely to
merge into that which he considers as most
<i>desirable</i>.&nbsp; His affections and his sympathy have been
so attractively led by the cases where such an union has been
effected, as has induced him to overlook many whose efficacy is
doubtful, and some, where the effects have rather hindered than
promoted the cause.&nbsp; But while I truly sympathise with him
in those views and feelings which, were it practicable, would
suggest such an union, the cool deliberations of sober judgment
are most convincing that the present state of things here in
reference to the feelings of various parties, presents
insuperable barriers, except at the expense of that cause which
it is our object mutually to advance.&nbsp; Now I would fairly
meet the question,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; On the ground afforded by experience within our own
locality.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; On that which is given to us on competent authority
from other places.</p>
<p>My reverend friend states at page 8, &ldquo;that hitherto the
labourers in the cause of Infant education in this city have been
principally Dissenters, but it is well known that they have
always desired and would have gladly received a greater number of
their brethren in the establishment as coadjutors.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is fairly coming to the point.&nbsp; There was no want of
courtesy&mdash;no lack of invitations, but there was a something
about those to whom those invitations were given, which kept them
back.&nbsp; The few from among the members <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of the
Establishment who have, as is stated at page 6 and 7, so
cordially and charitably joined in the direction and management,
are perhaps nearly all who could, even by increased exertion, be
drawn into active co-operation with the schools on their present
plan; and had this been tenaciously adhered to, the result of our
united exertions would have added but little to the present means
of extending the cause.&nbsp; The whole amount of experience
within our own locality so powerfully discourages the attempt to
coalesce, that I think no one would be induced to try the
experiment, who was well informed as to those facts which bear
upon the question.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Of the experience furnished by distant societies,
there doubtless are some, where the union has been tried to great
advantage.&nbsp; My reverend friend cannot feel more intense
satisfaction than I do, in thus witnessing the joyful and happy
state of brethren dwelling together in unity.&nbsp; If, however,
Mr. Wilderspin&rsquo;s book be competent authority, it is to be
feared that the cases are few.&nbsp; It more resembles a
chronicle of failure than of success&mdash;it savours more of
antipathies than of harmony, and leads to discouragement rather
than to hope.</p>
<p>Of the many cases therein mentioned, I will refer to only two,
and only to those because they have been selected by my reverend
friend, as among those where a satisfactory union had been
effected.&nbsp; The one is at Leicester, and is noticed at page
16&mdash;the other at Taunton, at page 17.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The case
of Leicester was one, of all others that have occurred or that
can occur, the most painfully illustrative of the difficulty of
effecting an efficient co-operation between parties so
uncongenial.&nbsp; Mr. Wilderspin has given but a partial outline
of the case in merely quoting the speech of Mr. Babington.</p>
<p>It was my unhappiness to be present at that meeting.&nbsp; The
place itself called up sacred recollections of days gone
by.&nbsp; It was there where Robinson the Episcopalian and Hall
the Nonconformist had been wont to meet with kindred affection,
and to unite their powerful energies in advocating the cause of
religion and benevolence as occasion might offer.&nbsp; It was on
this spot, sacred to Christian union and charity, where the sweet
yet brilliant eloquence of Hall had afterwards burst forth into
that memorable strain of eulogy on the character of his deceased
Christian brother&mdash;that now the Christian might have wept
tears of blood, on seeing the biographer of Robinson bearing the
rude personal taunts of Hall&rsquo;s talented, misguided
successor, followed by another speaker, equally talented, whose
coarse expressions and personalities were utterly at variance
with his Christian profession, and backed by the yells and
hootings of men of every creed, and men of no creed at all.&nbsp;
The individual on whom all this was lavished was, by birth and
education, a gentleman&mdash;by profession and practice an
active, pious, indefatigable, minister,&mdash;the brother of
Baron Vaughan, and whose only offence was, that he had stated his
opinions (erroneous as I <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>conceive) in language temperate and
respectful.&nbsp; The weak and feeble results of this meeting is
told in the words of Mr. Wilderspin, who says at page 95, that
&ldquo;there are now three schools, but, as they are managed by
women, though they do great good, the full amount of advantage is
not secured.&rdquo;&nbsp; The impression upon my own mind is that
it is all but a failure.</p>
<p>Nor is the quotation of the Taunton case more happy&mdash;Mr.
Wilderspin&rsquo;s account of this at page 118, exhibits clearly
another instance of the difficulty of such an union, and that the
altercation terminated in the establishment of two
schools&mdash;one by each party.</p>
<p>That there are cases of happy and beneficial union I admit,
and I rejoice in the fact that there are such; but that the
majority of cases in large towns are so I do greatly fear and
doubt.&nbsp; My reverend friend quotes the authority of Mr.
Wilderspin, at page 18, in a manner which requires
qualifying.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;These quotations abundantly
prove that the originator of Infant schools, who has visited many
of the towns in the three kingdoms, and who is, perhaps, better
qualified than any other person to form an opinion as to the best
mode of conducting them, is decidedly opposed to the exclusive
system advertised for Norwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I do humbly submit to the candid reader of Mr.
Wilderspin&rsquo;s book, that the cases he there notices, various
as they are in character, do not lead to this conclusion.&nbsp;
There may be cases, and I hope there are <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>many, where
&ldquo;the union of Churchmen and Dissenters is
delightful;&rdquo; but that there are others, which do but too
plainly tell the sad tale of the results of conflicting elements,
cannot be denied.&nbsp; Much stress has been laid throughout on
the value of the testimony of Mr. Wilderspin, and some of his
statements have been so interpreted, as to bear strongly in
favour of the union, when, as I have clearly shewn, they have a
directly contrary tendency.&nbsp; His book bears evidence that
his object is to promote infant instruction without any
distinction of the party who patronises it.&nbsp; He is the
willing agent of the Episcopalian or the Nonconformist; and,
however he may rejoice when the state of feeling will admit of an
union of all parties in one common bond of Christian love, he is
too keen an observer of the workings of human prejudices, not to
see that there are circumstances which would, in many cases,
render an union an occasion rather for widening than diminishing
the existing chasm.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I cannot help again recurring to a mistake into
which my reverend friend has fallen, and which is throughout
implied&mdash;in regard to the exclusion of the children of
dissent.&nbsp; He may rest assured that nothing is decided with
respect to the discipline of the schools, which can possibly be
held to be an impediment with any conscientious Dissenter, who
desires to place his child there:&mdash;no impeding tests or
testimonials on entering the school,&mdash;no offensive rituals
when there.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis one of misfortune&rsquo;s worst
mishaps to have a bad name, and the Churchman <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>is often
slandered unwittingly.&nbsp; In the present case we claim our
constitutional privilege of being heard before condemnation; and,
while we expect not the approbation of the ultra, either within
or without the pale of the Establishment, we do expect to meet
the cordial sympathy of the good, the benevolent, the pious
members of every denomination.&nbsp; A word or two on the subject
of my reverend friend&rsquo;s closing paragraph.&nbsp; Only let
whatever is done, be done in the spirit of love and of duty:
unhappily the field is wide enough, and too wide for us
both.&nbsp; Let each, caring only for the public good, plant his
school, not to annoy his associate in the benevolent work, but to
select the most destitute district for its operation.&nbsp; To
such a school there are, I have no doubt, Churchmen who will be
happy to contribute, if conducted on sound principles; and I take
my leave of my reverend friend&rsquo;s letter in the spirit which
animated the patriarch of old, when he says, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Let there be no strife I pray thee between me and
thee</span>, <span class="smcap">for we are brethren</span>;
<span class="smcap">is not the whole land before
thee</span>?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Separate thyself I pray
thee from me</span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">If thou wilt take
the left hand</span>, <span class="smcap">then I will go to the
right</span>, <span class="smcap">or if thou depart to the right
hand</span>, <span class="smcap">then I will go to the
left</span>.&rdquo;</p>
